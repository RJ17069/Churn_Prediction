Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting telecom customer churn is a crucial task for telecommunications companies as it helps them identify customers who are likely to leave the service. By identifying potential churners, telecom companies can implement targeted retention strategies to reduce customer attrition. Here's a general outline of the steps you can take for telecom customer churn prediction:

1. Data Collection and Exploration:
- Data Collection:
  - Gather historical customer data, including usage patterns, billing information, customer service interactions, and any other relevant features. Include both churned and non-churned customer data.
- Data Exploration:
  - Analyze the distribution of features.
  - Identify missing values and outliers.
  - Explore the correlation between different features.
2. Feature Importance Analysis:
- Analyze which features contribute most to the prediction of churn.
- This can help in understanding the factors influencing customer churn.
3. Data Preprocessing:
- Data Cleaning:
  - Handle missing values through imputation or removal.
  - Address outliers appropriately.
- Feature Engineering:
  - Create new features that might be indicative of churn.
  - Transform categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
4. Balance The Dataset:
- When dealing with imbalanced datasets in the context of telecom customer churn prediction, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) combined with Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN) is a common approach. This technique, known as SMOTEENN, helps balance the distribution of the target variable (churn vs. non-churn) by oversampling the minority class (churn) and removing noisy samples
5. Data Splitting:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. Model Selection:
- Choose appropriate machine learning models for prediction (e.g., decision trees, random forests). Consider using ensemble methods for improved performance.
7. Model Training:
- Train the selected models on the training dataset.
8. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the models using the testing dataset.
- Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
